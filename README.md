# Description

Welcome to the ``practica-par`` GitHub repository! This repo contains an interesting and innovative BigFoot simulator game implemented in several languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++ (partially). In the Python notebook you can find the following implementations: A standarised initial release that only provides a CLI output, a later remake supported by a deficient Python module (WxPython) that pretended to show the first release as an interactable user interface. In addition, there are several tries of automating the game by creating a function that returns the most optimal move in a given state of time or training a machine learning algorithm with Tensorflow/Pytorch based on reinforcement learning actor critic methods.
